                            <p>The Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) was formed in 1973 to be a denomination that is “Faithful to the Scriptures, True to the Reformed Faith, and Obedient to the Great Commission. ”The PCA is an evangelical denomination in that we proclaim the gospel of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The word “evangelical” comes from the Greek word meaning “good news.” We desire all people to trust in the saving work of Jesus and enjoy eternal life in him. The PCA is a reformed denomination in that we believe in the biblical truth proclaimed during the Protestant Reformation. The Word of God, rather than tradition, is the only guide for the Church. God alone saves through his immeasurable mercy and according to his sovereign plan. We believe the system of doctrine taught in the Bible is summarized well in the Westminster Confession of Faith with the Larger and Shorter Catechisms. The PCA is a Presbyterian denomination in that we have a representative form of church government. A local church is governed by a “Session” comprised of elders (i.e., “presbyters”) elected by the members of the congregation. Pastors and representatives of local churches in a region form a “Presbytery.” Representatives of Presbyteries and local churches meet annually at a “General Assembly.” The General Assembly Committees and Agencies help local churches combine their efforts and resources to advance God’s Kingdom more effectively.</p>

                            <p>We desire to unite PCA congregations who hold common theological convictions but have diverse ministry practices, in order to expand the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ to multiple generations of people of “every tribe and language and people and nation” (Revelation 5:9).</p>
                            <p>long to join in cooperative ministry with other parts of the universal church to pursue God’s global mission. We hope to engage the culture with Reformed thinking and leadership, along with deeds of love, mercy, and justice to show the transformational power of the gospel.</p>
