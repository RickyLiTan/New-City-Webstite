                            <p>Connan and his wife Brenda moved with two of their four kids back to his hometown of Calgary to become Lead Pastor of New City Church Calgary in September 2023. Prior to that he planted New City Church Hamilton and served as Lead Pastor there for 17 years. Connan is passionate about equipping local church congregations to take the whole gospel to their whole city. He is also passionate about seeing gospel-centred churches planted and to that end is Executive Director of The Grace Network Canada and a certified church planting coach with Church Multiplication Ministries. Connan looks forward to his resurrection body but in the meantime attempts to counter “the fall” with weights, running, and outdoor pursuits (including skiing again - hallelujah!). He enjoys reading a book accompanied by a good Americano, date nights with his wife, and spending time with his church family. Connan and Brenda, have four children: Kira and son-in-law Judah, Brysan, Evan, and Rylan. </p>
