                        <hr>
                        <p>Started in 2010, New City is a growing Christian church in Calgary, Alberta centered on 3 core values - Gospel, <strong>Community, and Mission.</strong> As a community of people redeemed through the Gospel of Jesus Christ, we are called to be a source of blessing to Calgary and the world through mission.</p>
                        <p>New City Church is a member of The Gospel Coalition and part of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). We believe the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments are the inspired Word of God, and affirm the historic beliefs of the faith as expressed in the Apostle's Creed and Westminster Confession of Faith.</p>

                        <p>New City Church is a worshiping community that exists to make the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ known among the people of Calgary in the hope of seeing the joy and peace of Christ’s Kingdom come to our great city.</p>

                            <p>We are learning that we are more deeply flawed, broken, and sinful than we often have the courage to admit, yet we can experience in Christ the love, acceptance, and forgiveness of God the Father.</p>

                            <p>We embrace the fact that part of the restoration of God’s original purposes for humanity includes living in genuine community with each other under God’s kind rule. The Gospel reconciles us to God and to each other, and together we learn a new way of being human.</p>
                            <p>We acknowledge that one cannot be a healthy follower of Christ apart from other believers, or what has been called ‘the communion of saints.’ Jesus forms us into a community of disciples where the Gospel develops a unique culture that permeates every relationship and part of the church.</p>
                            <p>We expect and welcome people who are not yet followers of Jesus Christ to be in our midst. Everyone is welcome - no matter what their background or their honest questions or struggles.</p>

                <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
                <hr>
                <p><strong>We believe the gospel of Jesus Christ completely transforms</strong> not only our lives, but also how we view all of life. It changes how we view ourselves: we learn to admit that we are more sinful and selfish than we could have imagined. It changes how we view God: we learn to marvel that we are more loved and forgiven than we could ever dare hope. It transforms how we view others: as divine image-bearers of incredible value and dignity.</p>
                <p><strong>We believe the Bible is the written word of God</strong>, inspired by the Holy Spirit and without error in the original manuscripts. The Bible is the revelation of God’s truth and is infallible and authoritative in matters of faith and practice.</p>
                <p><strong>We believe in the Holy Trinity.</strong> There is one God, who exists eternally in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
                <p><strong>We believe that all are sinners</strong> and totally unable to save themselves from God’s displeasure, except by His mercy.</p>
                <p><strong>We believe that salvation is by God alone</strong> as He sovereignly chooses those He will save. We believe His choice is based on His grace, not on any human individual merit, or foreseen faith.</p>
                <p><strong>We believe that Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God</strong>, who through His perfect life and sacrificial death atoned for the sins of all who will trust in Him, alone, for salvation.</p>
                <p><strong>We believe that God is gracious and faithful</strong> to His people not simply as individuals but as families in successive generations according to His Covenant promises.</p>
                <p><strong>We believe that the Holy Spirit indwells God’s</strong> people and gives them the strength and wisdom to trust Christ and follow Him.</p>
                <p><strong>We believe that Jesus will return</strong>, bodily and visibly, to judge all mankind and to receive His people to Himself.</p>
                <p><strong>We believe that all aspects of our lives are to be lived to the glory of God under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
